Installation Instructions
Here's how to integrate the auto-repair plugin into your current Stash Hunter code:
1. New Files to Create
Create these new files in your project:

src/main/java/com/stashhunter/stashhunter/modules/AutoElytraRepair.java (from first artifact)
src/main/java/com/stashhunter/stashhunter/utils/SafeLandingSpotFinder.java (from second artifact)

2. Existing Files to Update
Update StashHunterModule.java:

Add the import and integration code from the third artifact
This replaces the existing elytra checking logic with enhanced logic that works with the repair system

Update StashHunter.java (main class):

Add the module registration code from the fourth artifact
This registers the new AutoElytraRepair module with Meteor

Update Config.java:

Add the configuration variables and validation from the fifth artifact
This adds settings for repair thresholds and timeouts

Update StashHunterCommand.java:

Add the new repair command from the sixth artifact
This adds /stashhunter repair commands for monitoring and control

3. How the Auto-Repair System Works

Monitoring: Continuously checks elytra durability while stash hunting is active
Safe Landing: When durability drops below threshold, finds the safest landing spot within radius
Landing Process: Safely descends and lands, avoiding hazards like water, lava, or confined spaces
Repair Cycle: Activates AutoExp module and cycles through all elytras in inventory for mending
Resume Flight: Equips the best repaired elytra and resumes stash hunting

4. Configuration Options
The system adds these settings:

Repair Threshold: Durability level to trigger repair (default: 50)
Landing Radius: Search radius for safe spots (default: 64 blocks)
Repair Timeout: Maximum repair time (default: 300 seconds)
Discord Notifications: Alert on Discord during repairs (default: true)

5. Safety Features

Hazard Avoidance: Won't land in water, lava, or near dangerous blocks
Takeoff Clearance: Ensures sufficient overhead space for safe takeoff
Emergency Disconnect: If no safe landing spot found or all elytras are beyond repair
Progress Persistence: Saves trip progress before landing, resumes after repair

6. Commands

/stashhunter repair - Show current repair status
/stashhunter repair toggle - Enable/disable auto-repair system

The system integrates seamlessly with your existing Stash Hunter and will automatically handle elytra repairs without interrupting the scanning process, making your bot much more autonomous and reliable for long scanning operations.
